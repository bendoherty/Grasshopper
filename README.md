# BVN DH Grasshopper Assets #

This repository contains useful [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/ "The Grasshopper website") assets. The idea is that functional groupings of components can be committed, and then they can be itteratively refined as they are used.

If a component gets used a lot then it can be upgraded, from a group to a cluster, to a user component, to a .net plugin.

To make a new component, copy this template (below), put the assets into a directory and make an associated wiki page.
